  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-32, REQ-33, REQ-34) appear to be implemented in the diff. The backend Inquiry type gains an optional seedNumber field with migration support, the BookingForm adds a validated Seed Number field for the One Question service, and InquiriesTab displays the seed number for relevant inquiries.",

    {
      "description": "A backend/migration.mo file was added to handle data migration from OldInquiry (without seedNumber) to NewInquiry (with seedNumber), including OldActor/NewActor type definitions and a run() migration function.",
      "reason": "REQ-33 only requested backward compatibility and an optional field — it did not request a formal migration module file. While this supports the backward compatibility goal, it is an additional implementation artifact not explicitly requested.",
